# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our meetup group are required
to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code
throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to
help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**

## Need Help?

Our meetup is co-organized by {{ organizer_links | array_to_sentence_string }}.
You also have our contact details in the emails we've sent prior to the event.

## The Quick Version

Our meetup group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
We do not tolerate harassment of our community members in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including
talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Community members
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the
discretion of the community organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
Support staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organisers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from the community with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of community staff immediately.
Community staff will be identified at the start of each event.

Community staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security
or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any community event. We
value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at our event and workshop venues
and community-related social events.
