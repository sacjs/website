      What if I told you that you can run JavaScript on a device that costs less than $15. We will explore the fantastic world of JavaScript on hardware using Espruino, an embedded javascript interpreter for microcontrollers.

      *  Why is JavaScript suited for hardware?

      *  How does this compare with platforms like Tessel and Raspberry Pi?

      *  blink - the "hello world" of hardware.
