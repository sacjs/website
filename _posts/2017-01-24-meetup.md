    title: Optimizing React Performance with Immutable.js
    description: >
      React is really fast out of the box, but complex applications can trigger hot spots in React's Virtual DOM diffing algorithim that can slow down how quickly your application renders.

      Understanding React's API and leveraging tools like Immutable.js can help keep this hotspots at bay and can keep your app super smooth!
