    title: What's new in Intercooler.js
    description: >
      The last time I talked about intercooler at SacJS I was at version 0.4.9. We are now at v0.9.5, and a bunch of new features have dropped:


      * Pure CSS transition animations

      * AJAX history support rewrite

      * The `ic-action` attribute for pure client-side actions

      * Intercooler is now available via bower and CDNJS


      I'll go over these, as well as some new examples using it, and talk a bit about when I plan on cutting a 1.0

    title: Stateless Web Apps with Elm
    description: >
      I'll provide a brief introduction to Elm, a functional language that compiles to Javascript. I'll also talk about the benefits of immutability and the mindset shift that comes from debugging compiler errors vs in the console.
